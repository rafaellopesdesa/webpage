The CDF collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron collide just released a new measurement of the W boson mass. In my PhD I did the same measurement using the data from the D0 experiment. On the occasion of the latest measurement from the Tevatron, I gave an interview to the Science News magazing describing the importance of this new result.
