The work of our group has been highlight in two nice talks on [The 19th Workshop of the LHC Higgs Working Group](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1169286). Rafael gave a talk on [exotic Higgs decays](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1169286/contributions/5126696/) and Raoul RÃ¶ntsch (U. Milano) gave a talk on behalf of the [off-shell working group](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1169286/contributions/5126689/) including the nice result above from our student Dan Humphreys.
