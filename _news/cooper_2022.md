Our UMass ATLAS graduate student, Cooper Wagner (advised by [Verena](http://people.umass.edu/vimartin/)) was awarded the pretigious DOE Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) Program grant during the [first solicitation in 2022](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/wdts/scgsr/excel/SCGSR-2022-S1-Award-Offers-Accepted.xlsx). He will be working with Rafael at SLAC on the pre-production of the ITk Pixel Inner System during 2023. This grant will also allow him to complete the search for exotic Higgs decays in the $$H\to aa\to 2b2\tau$$ decay channel.
