Kickoff meeting for the [HSF-India project](http://research-software-collaborations.org/) in India. We visited TIFR Mumbai, IIT Bombay, University of Mumbai, IISER Pune, Bose National Center for Basic Science, SINP, AMU, and University of Delhi.

The idea is to create new collaborations between HEP institutions in US and India for the development of Software and Computing. We envision an exchange program for senior researchers, a fellowship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and training programs for younger students. Rafael gave a talk about the program:

This is the inception of a major multinational effort for software development in Analysis, Simulation, and Open Data.
