Our graduate student, Jay Sandesara was awarded the pretigious Chateaubriand Fellowship by the French government. The fellowship will allow Jay to spend one year at IJCLab/Saclay (France) to work with new Machine Learning methods for statistical data analysis. This fellowship will also allow him to continue his work on the measurement of the off-shell Higgs production in the $$H\to ZZ\to 4\ell$$ channel.
