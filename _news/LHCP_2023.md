Our newest search for light $$a\to\mu\mu$$ decays produced in association with top quarks has been highlighted in the [plenary talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1198609/contributions/5325936/attachments/2650594/4589241/LHCP2023_ATLAS.pdf) during the [LHCP 2023](https://lhcp2023.ac.rs/) conference. This work is the main result of Shreya Saha's PhD thesis. For her thesis, Shreya got the Yablonovitch Research Prize, given to a McGill graduating student for best research accomplishment in experimental physics.
