Rafael, [Verena](http://people.umass.edu/vimartin) and [St√©phane](https://blogs.umass.edu/willocq/) received a DOE award to support graduate students studying both experimental high-energy physics and computing science.

In the next 5 years, we will be able to support 10 UMass graduate students with this award. More details in [Research Funding](http://people.umass.edu/rclsa/services/funding/index.html).
